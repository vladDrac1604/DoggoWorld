                Diet is an important factor for the health and well-being of this breed and, furthermore, diet can be manipulated to assist and prevent both known defects within the breed and less common ones too. There are many appropriate options across complete foods, dry, tinned, home cooked and raw. Ultimately, an individual assessment of each dog’s requirements should be made to give him/her the best chance at a healthy life.
                Within the Gilbertson & Page family of feeds, the best option for Dalmatians is Dr John Silver. This complete food variety is formulated with a protein level of 18% and is low in purine-rich ingredients, with an oils and fats content of just 6%. 
                Make it a priority to keep your Dalmatian hydrated at all times as this helps to keep their urine dilute and easier to excrete. In extremis, some experts suggest using filtered or distilled water to keep excess minerals to a minimum.

                Dalmatians are prone to a variety of skin problems, including sebaceous adenitis. You may notice that your dog has dry, scaly skin with patches of hair loss along the top of his head, back of the neck, and along his back. This condition typically develops when your dog is between one and five years of age. Treatment is generally long term, and we’ll likely try a combination of approaches to determine which is most effective with your dog. The response to treatment is highly variable, but you’ll almost always need to give fatty acid supplements and use special shampoos to remove dead skin and hair.
                Dalmatian bronzing syndrome is a skin condition, specific to Dalmatians, that is not yet completely understood. Breeders also call it "Dal Crud", and it typically causes a broad stripe of pink or bronze coloration along the whole topline of the dog’s coat, with patchy hair loss and inflammation of the hair follicles as well. Early research looked for a connection with elevated uric acid levels, but further studies show no relation. A skin biopsy is needed to confirm a diagnosis of DBS, and if your pet is affected, he may develop periodic skin infections that can be managed with antibiotics and special shampoo.
                Much of what you can do to keep your dog happy and healthy is common sense, just like it is for people. Be sure to adhere to the schedule of examinations and vaccinations that we recommend for her. This is when we’ll give her the necessary “check-ups” and test for diseases and conditions that are common in Dalmatians.

                With Dalmatians, preventing urates is key, and there are a number of dietary interventions that can help prevent urate development. Try to keep your Dalmatians on a diet higher in pH i.e. more alkaline and aim for a urine pH of 6.5-7. This means restricting acidic ingredients like beef, pork, shellfish, eggs and maize gluten.
                Aim to keep their diet low in protein and purine content. It is important that Dalmatians have a maintenance level of protein in their diet, otherwise this can cause heart and liver problems but a restricted level of around 18% protein is ideal in a prevention diet. Restrict ingredients rich in purines such as meat proteins like beef, pork and sardines and also yeast. Oddly, the active ingredient in chocolate (threobromine) is also high in purine, providing another reason to not feed chocolate to dogs! Fruit, vegetables, cheese and potatoes are good ingredients but need to be balanced alongside the nutritional requirements of the dog, i.e. include some poultry or white fish and carbohydrate for energy and stamina.
